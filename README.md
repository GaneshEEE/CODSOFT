# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for GaneshEEE/CODSOFT

This project uses HTML and Playwright for testing a simple login form.  Since the project is a simple static HTML page, GitHub Actions will primarily focus on running Playwright tests to validate the form's functionality.


**1. Adding the workflow file:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This file will define the actions for your CI/CD pipeline.


```yaml
name: Run Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Node.js and Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16 # Or the latest LTS version

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npm install playwright --global

      - name: Run Playwright Tests
        run: |
          npx playwright test
          echo "PLAYWRIGHT TESTS COMPLETE"

```


**2. Environment variables:**

This project doesn't require any environment variables.


**3. Dependencies:**

The only dependency is Playwright, which is installed via npm (`npx playwright test`).


**4. Configuring the test framework (Playwright):**

* **Playwright Installation:**
    The YAML file already installs Playwright globally using npm.


* **Test Files:**
    The example test cases provided are suitable input for your HTML login form. Ensure that your Playwright tests are in a `tests` directory, ideally structured as per Playwright recommendations.


* **Local Testing (Crucial):**
    Before pushing to GitHub, **thoroughly test locally**.  Create a simple HTML file (`index.html`) containing your login form.  Open it in a web browser.  Manually verify the form works as expected and there are no immediate errors.


```html
<!--index.html example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="javascript:void(0)"> 
    <!--your login form here--> 
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```


**5. Viewing test results:**

GitHub Actions will output the test results to the Actions panel for each run.  Look for success or failure messages below the `Run Playwright Tests` step in the workflow run details.  Specific test failures (if any) will also be displayed.



**6. Troubleshooting:**

* **"npm install playwright --global" errors:** Ensure Node.js is correctly installed and `npm` can be called.
* **Playwright tests failing:**  Double-check your HTML form (errors in the form would prevent the tests from running correctly), your test cases, and verify the input values.


**7. Project-specific configuration steps (HTML):**

* **Local Server:** Use a simple local server (like `http-server`) to test your form.
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
This will start a server on `localhost:8080` for you to test the HTML in the browser.

* **HTML Validation:**  Use a validator like the one provided by [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure your HTML conforms to the standard.


* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Playwright will handle some cross-browser testing implicitly. However, for thoroughness, manually test on different browsers and devices (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on your local server.  For more comprehensive testing, use Playwright to directly target different browser versions.





**Important Considerations for a Real Project:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling in your HTML and Javascript.
* **Security:** Consider security best practices when handling user login credentials.
* **External Dependencies:** If you introduce external libraries/dependencies, ensure they're managed properly (e.g., via `package.json`).
* **Playwright Configuration:** If you're targeting a specific browser or browser version, configure Playwright accordingly.


This detailed setup provides a practical approach, aligning with the project's characteristics of a simple HTML form and Playwright tests. Remember to adapt the example code to your specific form structure and test cases.
